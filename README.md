# ZHdarkPhotonML

This is a package for hyperparameter optimization of the ZH dark photon NN using ATLAS grid GPU/CPU resources. 

It contains the following directories:
- [hpogrid](https://gitlab.cern.ch/aml/hyperparameter-optimization/alkaid-qt/hpogrid/-/tree/master/): the main work-horse
- `python`: contains the training script to be used
- `hpo_scripts`: contains the script needed to create the configurations to run/submit to the grid
